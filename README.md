## What can you do?

This web application lets you do all the basic stuff that is expected from a todo list and more! Not only is a CRUD app, you can filter an search through the entire todo list.

First, you can add a task to the list. You must describe it, else it will throw an error, but selecting a category is optional. You can add all the tasks you want!

After that, in the center of the application will be listed all the tasks. Each row represents a task and includes: description of task, category, edit button and delete button.
